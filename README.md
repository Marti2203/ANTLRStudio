# ANTLRStudio
This is an in development minimalistic IDE for ANTLRv4. It is not currently stable and only for a competition currently.
Current Version : _0.9_ for branches Windows + Gtk.
Currently work on an (Avalonia)[https://avaloniaui.net/] based version as Eto does not have a text editor component and we would like to have better Syntax Diagrams that can be built upon.
# Road Map
